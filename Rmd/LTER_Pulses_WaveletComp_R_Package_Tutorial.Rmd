The following is a tutorial for the 2022 LTER All Scientists' Meeting pulse dynamics workshop about the basic use of the WaveletComp R package for wavelet and cross-wavelet analysis of time series data of one and two variables, respectively. 

For a thorough discussion of WaveletComp, refer to **[the excellent guided tour document](http://www.hs-stat.com/projects/WaveletComp/WaveletComp_guided_tour.pdf)** that accompanies the package. The guided tour goes into much greater detail than this tutorial, and much of this tutorial's materials are based on the guided tour. 

A simple, template R script is also available along with this tutorial - see LTER_Pulses_WaveletComp_template.R.

### Basic background on wavelets  

Wavelets provide a method for studying periodic time series phenomena that may be either stationary or non-stationary over time. This allows for the examination of time series data in both the time and frequency domains.  

A wavelet function, the "mother" wavelet, is scaled (stretched and compressed) into a series of wavelet children. The children are shifted/translated across the entire time series. This is called a convolution of the time series with the wavelet children and is the wavelet transform. 

There are many types of wavelets and WaveletComp uses the Morlet wavelet:  

![](media/Morlet_wavelet.jpg "Morlet Wavelet")

The wavelet analysis provides the wavelet power spectrum that can be interpreted as time-frequency wavelet energy density, and is related to the amplitude of a periodic signal at a given point in time.  

The relationship between period and frequency is:  
Period = 1 / Frequency

There is a trade off between time and frequency resolution. Long periods are well detected in the frequency domain, but poorly localized in the time domain. Short periods are well detected in the time domain, but poorly localized in the frequency domain.   

Through the wavelet transform, it is possible to identify what periodicities are most strongly present in a univariate time series.  

By utilizing a series of simulations, WaveletComp tests the null hypothesis of *no periodicity* using a white noise process or several other test options. Regions of the time series that are significantly different from the null may be identified in the model output and visualizations. 

Cross-wavelet analysis allows for comparison of the frequency contents of a bivariate time series, thus allowing for an examination of synchronicity or coherency between the two time series. Coherency is analogous to classical correlation. The cross-wavelet power shows the similarity of the bivariate time series' wavelet power in the time-frequency domain. It also allows for the assessment of how closely in/out of phase the two time series are.

Some examples will help to provide a better understanding of the wavelet transform of time series data.

### The Data  

One synthetic data example is provided that is directly from the guided tour.  

The other data used in the examples below are daily AmeriFlux data from the US-Seg: Sevilleta grassland flux tower located on the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge in New Mexico from 2007-2020. Latitude/Longitude: 34.3623, -106.7020. Elevation: 1596 m. See [the AmeriFlux site info page](https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/sites/siteinfo/US-Seg) for more information. Variables from the data that are used in the tutorial include daily mean air temperature, precipitation, and net ecosystem exchange (NEE). 


----  

### The Context  

Utilize wavelets to conduct cross-site comparisons of pulse dynamics within (and beyond) the LTER Network.  

Motivating questions include:  

1. At what temporal scales are the major sources of variance (pulsed-ness) in abiotic resources and conditions?   
2. How have the pulse regimes of abiotic resources and conditions changed over time?     
3. How strongly have ecological responses tracked abiotic pulse regimes, and how large are the lags in response?  



----  

### The Setup  

Several R packages are loaded along with the daily US-Seg data.  


```{r message=FALSE}
library(WaveletComp)
library(dplyr)
library(matrixStats)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
library(readr)
```



```{r}
seg <- read_csv("~/Documents/LTER_Pulse_Time_Series_WG/SEV_daily_flux/US-Seg_daily_aflx.csv") %>% 
  mutate(date = mdy(Date)) %>%         # WaveletComp expects date var named "date"
  select(-Date) %>% 
  select(date, everything()) %>% 
  arrange(date)                  # make sure data are properly sorted in chronological order
```


Let's take a quick look at the data we are working with.  

Data structure:  
```{r}
str(seg)
```

Data summary:  
```{r}
summary(seg)
```

Notice that there are no missing data. WaveletComp requires a complete time series without missing data. It may be necessary for you to preprocess your data to gap fill any missing data.  


Data head:  
```{r}
head(seg, 10)
```

### Example 1 - US-Seg Average Daily Temperature Wavelet Analysis  

This first example examines the underlying periodic structures of US-Seg mean daily temperature in Celsius. The example exhibits simple periodic structure, but it is a useful introduction to wavelets.  

The US-Seg Average Daily Temperature time series:  
```{r}
seg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = TA_avg)) +
  geom_line(size = 0.4, color = "tan") +
  labs(title = "US-Seg - Average Daily Temperature\n2007-2020",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Average Temperature (C)")
```




The `analyze.wavelet` function performs the wavelet transformation and provides the power spectrum for mean daily temperature for the time series:  

```{r}
seg_ta_avg.w <- analyze.wavelet(seg, "TA_avg",
                                loess.span = 0.75,
                                dt = 1, dj = 1/20,
                                make.pval = TRUE, method = "white.noise",
                                n.sim = 25)   # should set n.sim higher - default is 100

```

`analyze.wavelet` has numerous arguments that you can set and tweak from their defaults, so check out the documentation for the function using `?analyze.wavelet` in the R console.  

----  


**What do you think the most powerful period(s) will be for the average daily temperature time series?**  

```{r}
# you can define your continuous color palette
# mypalette <-  "terrain.colors(100)" 

wt.image(seg_ta_avg.w,
         col.contour = "white",
         # color.palette = mypalette,
         lwd = 1.5,
         show.date = TRUE,
         main = "US-Seg Flux Tower Daily Mean Air Temperature (C)",
         legend.params = list(width = 1.8, label.digits = 4, lab = "Power"))
```

The most powerful periods in the time series are around the annual temperature cycle of ~365 days. However, if you look closely, there are a couple of other periods with high power at certain time ranges in the time series.  


The average power of the entire time series can be graphed:    

```{r}
# look at the average power of the series
maximum.level = 1.001*max(seg_ta_avg.w$Power.avg) # See WaveletComp Guided Tour for explanation
wt.avg(seg_ta_avg.w, maximum.level = maximum.level,
       legend.coords = "bottomright",
       main = "Average Power for US-Seg Mean Daily Air Temperature")
```

Because the wavelet transform preserves information, it is possible to reconstruct the original time series for the time periods whose average power were found to be significantly different from a white noise structure: 
 
```{r}
reconstruct(seg_ta_avg.w,
            show.date = TRUE,
            legend.coords = "bottomright",
            ylim = c(-40, 20),
            main = "Reconstruction of US-Seg Flux Tower \nDaily Mean Airt Temperature",
            col = c('tan', 'black'))
```


`analyze.wavelet` produces several results variables that can be used for further analysis. After inspecting the wavelet image, it may be interesting to look more closely at powerful periods in certain time ranges. The period information output from `analyze.wavelet` may be used to pinpoint and examine periodicities of interest:  

```{r}
seg_ta_avg.w$Period
```

Let's look at the power of the periods around 365. The 365-day period is between records 151 and 152. The following looks at a broad range of periods between 256 and 512 days. 

Convert power data to a matrix:  

```{r}
seg_ta_avg.w_power <- as.matrix(seg_ta_avg.w$Power)

```


The dimensions of the Power matrix have the number of periods as columns and the number of records in the time series as rows:  

```{r}
dim(seg_ta_avg.w$Power)
```


From this, it is possible to pull out various results from `analyze.wavelet`. For example, here are the results looking at the periodicities from 256 to 512:  
```{r}
seg_256_to_512_power <- as.matrix(seg_ta_avg.w_power[141:161,])

dimnames(seg_256_to_512_power) <- list(paste0("period_", round(seg_ta_avg.w$Period[141:161], 2)))

seg_256_to_512_power_t <- as_tibble(t(seg_256_to_512_power))

seg_256_to_512_power_df <- tibble(date = seg$date, seg_256_to_512_power_t)

seg_256_to_512_power_df_long <- seg_256_to_512_power_df %>% 
  pivot_longer(contains("period_"))

seg_256_to_512_power_df_long %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = value, color = name)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ name) +
  theme(legend.position="none") +
  labs(title = "Average daily temperature periods around 365",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Power")


```


----  

Looking closely at the wavelet image, there appears to be some high power periods in 2011 between 20 and 50 day periods:  

```{r, echo=FALSE}
wt.image(seg_ta_avg.w,
         col.contour = "white",
         # color.palette = mypalette,
         lwd = 1,
         show.date = TRUE,
         main = "US-Seg Flux Tower Daily Mean Air Temperature (C)",
         
         legend.params = list(width = 1.8, label.digits = 4))
```

This is the time series for 2011:  

```{r}
seg %>% 
  filter(year(date) == 2011) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = TA_avg)) +
  geom_line(size = 0.6) +
  labs(title = "2011 Daily Average Temperature (C)")
```

There was a strong freeze in February 2011, and this shows up in the wavelet transform. 

To pull out the 2011 data from `analyze.wavelet`, identify the 2011 records:  
```{r}
(start_2011 <- ymd("2011-01-01") - ymd(min(seg$date)))
```

```{r}
(end_2011 <- ymd("2011-12-31") - ymd(min(seg$date)))
```


Then look at power bands for periods 20-50 in 2011:  
```{r}
seg_2011_power <- as.matrix(seg_ta_avg.w_power[68:94, 1461:1825])

dimnames(seg_2011_power) <- list(paste0("period_", round(seg_ta_avg.w$Period[68:94], 2)))

seg_2011_power_t <- as_tibble(t(seg_2011_power))

seg_2011_power_df <- tibble(date = seq(from = ymd("2011-01-01"),
                                       to = ymd("2011-12-31"),
                                       by = "1 day"), 
                            seg_2011_power_t)

seg_2011_power_df_long <- seg_2011_power_df %>% 
  pivot_longer(contains("period_"))

seg_2011_power_df_long %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = value, color = name)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ name) +
  theme(legend.position="none") +
  labs(title = "Average daily temperature in 2011",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Power") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
```

This first example was used to show a basic analytic process for analyzing wavelets and how to identify high power regions of interest in a univariate time series. 
 


----  

### Example 2 - Non-stationary synthetic data  

This synthetic example shows how wavelets can detect changes in periodicity throughout the time series (time-period domain). This is an advantage over other techniques that cannot detect non-stationarity.  


This example comes directly from the guided tour.  


First, produce synthetic/pretend data:  
```{r}
# made up data for example
x1 <- periodic.series(start.period = 100, length = 400)
x2 <- 1.5*periodic.series(start.period = 50, length = 200)
x  <- c(x1, x2, x1) + 0.2*rnorm(1000)

pretend.data <- data.frame(x = x)
```


```{r}
pretend.data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = seq(from = 1, to = 1000, by=1), y = x)) +
  geom_line(size = 0.6, color = "tan") +
  labs(title = "Non-Stationary Data Example",
       x = "time",
       y= "value")
```



Then conduct the wavelet transform and visualize:   
```{r}

pretend.w <- analyze.wavelet(pretend.data, "x",
                        method = "white.noise",
                        loess.span = 0,
                        dt = 1, dj = 1/250,
                        lowerPeriod = 32, upperPeriod = 256,
                        make.pval = TRUE, n.sim = 10)

wt.image(pretend.w, color.key = "interval", n.levels = 250,
          legend.params = list(lab = "wavelet power levels"))
```

Notice how the wavelet image clearly identifies the changes in dominant periods throughout the time series.  

----  

### Example 3 - Cross-wavelet analysis - US-Seg Precipitation and Net Ecosystem Exchange  

Cross-wavelet analysis can be used to examing two time series variables at the same time to identify synchronicities and phase differences between the variables.   

The two variables for this analysis are:  

- Daily Precipitation (mm) - P_int  
- Net Ecosystem Exchange (gC/m^2) - NEE_int  

Before conducting the cross-wavelet analysis, let's take look at the two variables by themselves. 

```{r}
seg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = P_int)) +
  geom_line(size = 0.4, color = "tan") + 
  labs(title = "US-Seg - Daily Precipitation",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Precipitation (mm)")
```

```{r}
seg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = NEE_int)) +
  geom_line(size = 0.4, color = "tan") + 
  labs(title = "US-Seg - Net Ecosystem Exchange",
       x = "Date",
       y = "NEE (gC/m^2)")
```


And conduct univariate wavelet transforms:  
```{r}
seg_p_int.w <- analyze.wavelet(seg, "P_int",
                                loess.span = 0.75,
                                dt = 1, dj = 1/20,
                                make.pval = TRUE, method = "white.noise",
                                n.sim = 25)
```


```{r}
mypalette <-  "terrain.colors(100)" 

wt.image(seg_p_int.w,
         col.contour = "white",
         color.palette = mypalette,
         lwd = 1,
         show.date = TRUE,
         main = "US-Seg Flux Tower Daily Precipitation (mm)",
         
         legend.params = list(width = 1.8, label.digits = 4))
```


```{r}
seg_nee_int.w <- analyze.wavelet(seg, "NEE_int",
                                loess.span = 0.75,
                                dt = 1, dj = 1/20,
                                make.pval = TRUE, method = "white.noise",
                                n.sim = 100)
```
```{r}
wt.image(seg_nee_int.w,
         col.contour = "white",
         color.palette = mypalette,
         lwd = 1,
         show.date = TRUE,
         main = "US-Seg Flux Tower Net Ecosystem Exchange (gC/m^2)",
         plot.ridge = FALSE,
         legend.params = list(width = 1.8, label.digits = 4))
```


Now that we've looked at the two variables by themselves, it is time to conduct the cross-wavelet analysis of US-Seg precipitation and NEE:    

```{r}
seg_precip_nee <- seg %>%
  select(date, P_int, NEE_int) %>%
  as.data.frame()


seg_precip_nee.wc <- analyze.coherency(seg_precip_nee, my.pair = c("P_int", "NEE_int"),
                                       loess.span = 0.75,
                                       dt = 1, dj = 1/20,
                                       make.pval = TRUE,
                                       n.sim = 20)

```

```{r}
wc.image(seg_precip_nee.wc,
         main = "Cross-wavelet power spectrum for\nUS-Seg Precipitation and NEE",
         legend.params = list(lab = "cross-wavelet power levels"),
         periodlab = "period (days)",
         col.contour = "white",
         color.palette = mypalette,
         lwd = .8,
         show.date = TRUE,
         col.arrow = "red",
         which.image = "wp"
)
```

The cross-wavelet power shows the similarity of the bivariate time series’ wavelet power in the time-frequency domain. Arrows to the right indicate when the two variables are in phase with one another, and arrows to the left indicate when the two variables are in anti-phase. 

----  

### Final Thoughts  

WaveletComp is a useful R package for conducting continuous wavelet-based analyses to identify periodicities in univariate or bivariate time series. Wavelets may be a useful tool for detecting transient high power pulses in a time series. There are many options available in WaveletComp for adjusting a wavelet analysis, and more detailed information can be found in the guided tour and package documentation.
